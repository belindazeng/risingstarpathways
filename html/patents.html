            <h3> PENDING: Improved X-Ray Laser Microscopy System and Method </h3>
              <p> Improved system and method of X-ray laser microscopy that combines information obtained from both X-ray diffraction and X-ray imaging methods.  The sample is placed in an ultra-cold, ultra-low pressure vacuum chamber, and exposed to brief bursts of coherent X-ray illumination further concentrated using X-ray mirrors and pinhole collimation methods.  Higher resolution data from a sample is obtained using hard X-ray lasers, such as free electron X-ray lasers, and X-ray diffraction methods.  Lower resolution data from the same sample can be obtained using any of hard or soft X-ray laser sources, and X-ray imaging methods employing nanoscale etched zone plate technology.  In some embodiments both diffraction and imaging data can be obtained simultaneously. Data from both sources are combined to create a more complete representation of the sample.

            <h3> PENDING: Energy harvest convert motion to electricity using multiple degree of freedom pendulum device </h3>
              <p> An energy harvester system (EHS) for converting pendulum motion into rotational motion is provided. The EHS includes a pendulum, a pointing element, and motion control slots (MCSs) enclosed in an external housing. The pointing element is slidably positioned on a rod of the pendulum. Ambient motion from the external housing generates a pendulum motion in the pendulum. The MCSs receive a connector that connects the pointing element to the rod of the pendulum and allows the connector to traverse the MCSs thereby controlling slidable movement of the pointing element along with the pendulum. When the pendulum moves to first ends of the MCSs in a first direction, the pointing element slides on the rod to allow a pointer of the pointing element to contact and rotate a gear within the external housing, thereby converting the pendulum motion into rotational motion of the gear, which drives an electric generator.

            <h3> PENDING: Energy harvester system </h3>
              <p> An energy harvester system including a primary energy collector (PEC), a cam gear ring, multiple secondary energy collectors (SEC), and a central gear is provided. The PEC and the SECs harness ambient motion energy. The PEC is attached to a support base member. The cam gear ring is in engageable communication with the PEC and rotated by the PEC. The SECs are positioned in a space defined by the cam gear ring and rotated on receiving ambient motion energy. One SEC is unclamped from the support base member and slides towards the central gear when the cam gear ring contacts the SEC, while the other SECs are clamped on the support base member. The central gear operably engages with the SEC that slid towards the central gear and rotates with the SEC. The rotating central gear can be coupled to a variety of power generating devices for generating electrical energy.
